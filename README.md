## TodoList

Hello everyone!

While learning React, I've decided that it is time to start building projects of my own. And it is a nice tradition for almost every Frontend Developer to create an app that simulates a Todo List.

In this particular app a user cann add, delete and mark/unmark his/her todos as completed. Moreover, it is possible to filter todos by the completion stage. Check it out!


In my Todo List React app I use only functional components and hooks for creating the state. 


In later versions I am going to add a function of saving the todos to the local storage, so that they could be added again after refreshing the page.


If you have any remarks and/or comments, feel free to contact me.
